<h1>Power BI - Model Performance Monitor Model</h1>

 

<h2>Description</h2>
I have developed a comprehensive model to monitor the daily performance of a series of QlikView Models used by various teams within our organization. The primary objective of this model is to promptly alert the Development team whenever new failures occur and take proactive measures to identify and resolve the root cause of these failures, thereby minimizing any significant negative impact on end users.

To achieve this, I utilized Power BI's capabilities along with Power Automate for automated alerts. The data for the Power BI model was sourced from a Python script, which reads log files generated by the QlikView models after each run. The Python script extracts the start and finish times of each run, as well as records whether the model failed in each particular run. This data is then organized into a dataframe, saved as a CSV, and subsequently read by the Power BI model for analysis and visualization.

The ultimate goal is to maintain a 70% success rate for all QlikView models, ensuring efficient operations and a positive user experience.
